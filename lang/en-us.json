We are at the bringe if incredible innovations.",

It is not as anonymous as hard-cash, but↵            its significantly more than credit card or bank transactions. Also,↵            there are tools available and under development that promote privacy↵            through Bitcoin, as well as technologies to protect against↵            financial corruption and voting systems.",
  "HELP.QUESTION_NINE": "Can I walk into a store and buy using Bitcoin?",

Many online services↵            offer convenient applications for both the consumer and the store to↵            buy and sell very easily using Bitcoin. Now you can find many ATMs↵            selling Bitcoin, but the number of 2-way ATMs (the ones that sell↵            and buy) is increasing.",
  "HELP.QUESTION_TEN": "What is Bitcoin Mining?",
  "HELP.QUESTION_TEN_ANSWER_ONE": "Similar to gold mining, Bitcoin mining is the process by which you↵            digitally dig for Bitcoin, by running special scripts with↵            algorithmic equations and hash functions that verify transactions on↵            the blockchain. This process allows the confirmation of↵            transactions, and adds new Bitcoin to the blockchain, and as a↵            reward the miner receives Bitcoin.",
